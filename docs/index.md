## Get started

`uv` is used in this project. Please install it as:

```bash
# install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

sudo apt update
sudo apt install direnv
```

Make sure commands `uv` are on your path.

Also, this project requires NVIDIA GPU. To check whether your GPU is available and is working:

```bash
nvidia-smi
```
If the GPU is working correctly, this command will display detailed information, including driver version, GPU usage, memory usage, and temperature.

Make sure the command `uv` are on your path. Then please clone the repo, set up the virtual environment and run tests:

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:microsoft/SNRAware.git

# set up env
direnv allow
cd ./SNRAware
uv sync

# run the test
uv run pytest -m gpu ./test
```

## Training data

Dataset for MR denoising training is not opened at this moment. More information will be provided once training data is released.

## Model
Three models are released at https://huggingface.co/microsoft/SNRAware

- SNRAware-small: 27.7million parameters
- SNRAware-medium: 55.1million parameters
- SNRAware-large: 109million parameters

To test the model, 
```bash
# download the model from the huggingface
# small model
wget --directory-prefix=./small/ https://huggingface.co/microsoft/SNRAware/resolve/main/small/snraware_small_model.pts
wget --directory-prefix=./small/ https://huggingface.co/microsoft/SNRAware/resolve/main/small/snraware_small_model.yaml

# or install the huggingface cli
curl -LsSf https://hf.co/cli/install.sh | bash
# download model
hf download Microsoft/SNRAware --local-dir .

# a test data is provided at ./test/data/inference
# input data are [H, W, Frame] 3D complex tensor, input_real.npy and input_imag.npy store the 
# real and imaginary part
# gmap.npy is the g-factor map for all frames or for every frame, [H, W, 1 or Frame]

# let's use the small model to run a inference
export model_file=./small/snraware_small_model.pts
export config_file=./small/snraware_small_model.yaml

# run the inference
uv run python3 ./src/snraware/projects/mri/denoising/run_inference.py --input_dir ./test/data/phantom --output_dir /tmp/phantom_res_inference --saved_model_path $model_file --saved_config_path $config_file --batch_size 1 --input_fname input --gmap_fname gmap
```

After the run, the result is saved in the `/tmp/phantom_res_inference` as numpy files.
